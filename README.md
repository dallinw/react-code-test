# Notes on this challenge

* I chose to use Typescript because I wanted a big âž• (and because it's great).
* I also implemented Redux to manage state across the app.
* A few basic tests can be found in App.test.ts
* Certain things could have perhaps been simplified by ignoring certain linter rules (like disabling exhaustive dependencies in a useEffect hook), but in this case I opted to follow all the rules.
